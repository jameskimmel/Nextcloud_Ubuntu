# Nextcloud_Ubuntu
Bare-metal installation of Nextcloud on an Ubuntu server tutorial. The goal of this guide is to have no warnings in the admin center and the instance should get a perfect security score from scan.nextcloud.com. 
One tutorial for a simple Apache2 instance, the other one for a instance behind a NGINX proxy.
