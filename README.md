# Nextcloud_Ubuntu
This is a Nextcloud bare-metal installation on an Ubuntu server tutorial.  
The goal of this guide is to have no warnings in the admin center and the instance should get a perfect security score from scan.nextcloud.com.  
There are two tutorials, the default one and one behind a NGIXN reverse proxy.
