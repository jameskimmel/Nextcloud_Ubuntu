# Nextcloud_Ubuntu
This is a Nextcloud bare-metal installation on an Ubuntu server tutorial.   
The goal of this guide is to have no warnings in the admin center and the instance should get a perfect security score from [the nextcloud security scanner](https://scan.nextcloud.com).  
There are two tutorials. 
Normal one is [nextcloud.md](https://github.com/jameskimmel/Nextcloud_Ubuntu/blob/main/nextcloud.md) and [nextcloud_behind_NGINX_proxy.md](https://github.com/jameskimmel/Nextcloud_Ubuntu/blob/main/nextcloud_behind_NGINX_proxy.md) is if you want to run Nextcloud behind a NGINX reverse proxy.
